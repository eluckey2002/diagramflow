# Infinite Canvas - Implementation Context

## Overview
This document provides additional context and considerations for implementing the infinite canvas feature. It serves as a supplementary guide to the technical analysis, solution design, and work breakdown documents.


## Technical Dependencies

### External Libraries
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "fabric": "^5.x",
    "react": "^18.x",
    "zustand": "^4.x",
    "typescript": "^5.x"
  }
}
```

### Browser APIs
- Canvas API
- RequestAnimationFrame
- Pointer Events
- ResizeObserver
- Web Workers (future optimization)

## Related Features

### Current Sprint Dependencies
1. Grid System (US-3)
   - Grid must scale with canvas zoom
   - Grid spacing affects snap points
   - Grid visibility toggles

2. Zoom Controls (US-2)
   - Zoom levels affect canvas rendering
   - Zoom operations interact with pan state
   - Zoom affects object visibility

### Future Feature Considerations
1. Object Selection (Sprint 2)
   - Selection must work with pan/zoom
   - Selection bounds must update with viewport
   - Multi-select implications

2. Connectors (Sprint 3)
   - Must update with viewport changes
   - Performance implications with many connectors
   - Endpoint handling during pan/zoom

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Rendering Optimizations
1. Viewport Culling
   ```typescript
   interface ViewportBounds {
     left: number;
     top: number;
     right: number;
     bottom: number;
     zoom: number;
   }
   ```
   - Only render objects in viewport
   - Add padding for smooth scrolling
   - Update bounds during pan/zoom

2. Object Pooling
   ```typescript
   class ObjectPool<T> {
     private pool: T[] = [];
     private active: Set<T> = new Set();
     
     acquire(): T {
       // Reuse or create object
     }
     
     release(obj: T): void {
       // Return to pool
     }
   }
   ```
   - Pool frequently created objects
   - Limit pool size based on memory
   - Clear pool on low memory

### Memory Management
1. Garbage Collection
   - Minimize object creation during pan/zoom
   - Clear object references properly
   - Monitor memory usage

2. State Management
   - Compress history states
   - Limit undo/redo stack size
   - Clear old states periodically

## Error Handling Scenarios

### Common Error Cases
1. Canvas Initialization
   ```typescript
   try {
     initializeCanvas();
   } catch (e) {
     if (e instanceof CanvasError) {
       // Handle specific canvas errors
     }
     // Fallback to basic mode
   }
   ```

2. State Management
   ```typescript
   try {
     updateState();
   } catch (e) {
     if (e instanceof StateError) {
       // Attempt state recovery
     }
     // Reset to last known good state
   }
   ```

### Recovery Strategies
1. Canvas Reset
   - Save current state
   - Reinitialize canvas
   - Restore saved state
   - Notify user if needed

2. State Recovery
   - Maintain backup state
   - Implement state validation
   - Provide manual recovery options

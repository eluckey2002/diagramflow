# Infinite Canvas - Technical Analysis

## Requirements Analysis

### Core Requirements
- Implement boundless workspace for unlimited content
- Support smooth pan functionality
- Maintain consistent performance while navigating
- Handle window resize events effectively
- Support zoom range from 25% to 400%


## Technical Constraints

### Memory Management
- Group nesting limited to 5 levels
- Undo/redo stack size limited to 100 operations
- Command storage optimized for memory
- Object pooling for frequently created elements
- Garbage collection optimization

### Event Handling
- Pan/zoom events throttled to 60fps (16ms)
- Object manipulation throttled to 30fps (32ms)
- Save operations debounced to 1s
- Selection changes debounced to 150ms
- Text input debounced to 100ms

### Browser Limitations
- Maximum canvas size per browser
- DOM element size restrictions
- Event handling performance
- Memory management constraints

## Proposed Approach

### Canvas Management
1. Fabric.js Implementation
   - Utilize Fabric.js for core canvas operations
   - Implement custom viewport management
   - Set up event handling system
   - Configure canvas sizing and scaling

2. Viewport Optimization
   - Implement viewport culling for off-screen objects
   - Use spatial indexing for object management
   - Optimize render cycles based on viewport
   - Cache rendered objects when possible

3. Performance Strategies
   - Implement object pooling for frequently created elements
   - Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
   - Batch render updates
   - Implement progressive loading for large canvases

### Group Management
1. Flat Storage with Hierarchical References
   ```typescript
   interface GroupStructure {
     flattenedChildren: Map<string, Shape>;
     hierarchy: Map<string, string[]>;
   }
   ```
   Benefits:
   - O(1) object lookup
   - Simplified rendering
   - Reduced memory overhead
   - Better garbage collection

2. Depth Limitations
   - Maximum nesting depth: 5 levels
   - Depth tracking per group
   - Clear error handling
   - Visual feedback for limits

### Event System
1. Performance Controls
   ```typescript
   interface EventControls {
     throttle: Map<string, number>;
     debounce: Map<string, number>;
   }
   ```
   Benefits:
   - Optimized UI responsiveness
   - Reduced CPU usage
   - Controlled memory growth
   - Better battery life

2. Event Categories
   - Viewport events (60fps)
   - Object events (30fps)
   - System events (debounced)
   - UI events (debounced)

### State Management
1. Memory-Aware History
   ```typescript
   interface HistoryConfig {
     maxStackSize: number;     // 100 operations
     maxMemoryMB: number;      // 50MB
     commandCompression: boolean;
   }
   ```
   Benefits:
   - Predictable memory usage
   - No garbage collection spikes
   - Efficient undo/redo
   - Automatic cleanup

2. Command Structure
   ```typescript
   interface Command {
     type: CommandType;
     targetIds: string[];      // References not objects
     delta: Partial<Changes>;  // Only changed properties
     timestamp: number;
   }
   ```
   Benefits:
   - Minimal memory footprint
   - Fast serialization
   - Efficient storage
   - Easy compression

## Performance Optimizations

### Memory Management
1. Object Pooling
   - Reuse frequent objects
   - Minimize allocation
   - Batch cleanup
   - Memory monitoring

2. Garbage Collection
   - Scheduled cleanup
   - Reference management
   - Memory thresholds
   - Warning system

### Rendering Pipeline
1. Viewport Culling
   - Only render visible objects
   - Progressive loading
   - Cache management
   - Update prioritization

2. Batch Processing
   - Group similar operations
   - Optimize redraws
   - Minimize state updates
   - Efficient transforms

## Dependencies
- Fabric.js v5.x
- Zustand v4.x
- React 18
- TypeScript 5.x

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Implement group management
3. Set up event system
4. Add memory management
5. Implement performance monitoring
6. Add error handling

## Version History
- v1.1.0 (January 25, 2024) - Updated with performance optimizations
- v1.0.0 (January 25, 2024) - Initial technical analysis
